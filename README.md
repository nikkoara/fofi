# Font file identification

A program which identifies the type and/or content of a font file.

## Licensing, etc.

The program is a rewrite of the font file identification code in version 3 of xpdf. Because it keeps the original enum names it also preserves the copyright notices as well as the original licensing -- GPL2, GPL3, or both.
